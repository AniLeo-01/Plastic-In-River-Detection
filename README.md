# Plastic-In-River-Detection

## Objective

Plastic pollution in marine environnement is a global threat. It threatens marine species health, human health, food security, costal tourism. More than 350 million tons of plastic are produced every year and it is estimated that more than 15 million tons end up in the world Ocean. The plastic then degrades over time into micro-plastic and both macro and microplastic have serious environmental impacts. Rivers are the very first source of plastic in Oceans. It is estimated that more than 80% of river plastic comes from only 1000 rivers.

Plastic detection models could play a huge role in the struggle against plastic pollution. It could equip autonomous boats to clean rivers or analyze videos from many sources to detect areas with a high plastic density.
